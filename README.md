## About Me

I am a Master's student at **The University of Tokyo**, Department of Civil Engineering, supervised by **Prof. Eiji Hato**.  
My research focuses on **autonomous driving, traffic flow theory, and deep learning-based car-following models**.  
I am particularly interested in integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and differential games into vehicle trajectory prediction, with applications to mixed traffic environments where automated and human-driven vehicles coexist.
